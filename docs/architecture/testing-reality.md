# Testing Reality

## Current Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: None
- **Integration Tests**: None
- **E2E Tests**: None
- **Manual Testing**: Primary (and only) QA method

## Running Tests

```bash
# Tests don't exist, but if they did:
pytest           # Would run unit tests
pytest --cov     # Would run with coverage
```

**Note**: pytest is installed but no test files exist. This is a significant gap for a production application.
